# NFT SDKs in Polkadot Ecosystem

Although Polkadot does not provide an NFT-specific SDK their legacy SDK, the [Polkadot{.js}](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/) has been utilised to this effect. Recently, however, focus has shifted toward their API, the [Polkadot API (PAPI)](https://papi.how/) that provides a more convenient way to develop dApps and mint NFTs. In a similar approach [Dedot](https://github.com/dedotdev/dedot) provides a lightweight SDK that attempts to optimise code bulk and speed. [Unique Network's SDK](https://docs.unique.network/build/sdk/v2/quick-start.html) allows fast and easy development with their approach applied to both Asset Hub and their native pallets unifying the NFT experience across chains. Apillon also provides a way to deploy contracts and mint NFTs but via a Web3 drag-and-drop interface on Moonbeam, Astar, Asset Hub and Unique Network. Although it is not an SDK per se, the [Apillon API](https://wiki.apillon.io/build/1-apillon-api.html) provides all the elements necessary to access the underlying processes making it a viable albeit somewhat different approach.
