# NFT UI Explorers 

### What is UI Explorer/Block Explorer

A Block Explorer UI is a web-based interface that visually presents blockchain data, enabling users to navigate transactions, accounts, and network activity in an accessible way. It acts as a front-end layer for blockchain indexing services, making raw blockchain data readable and interactive for end users.

In our article we focus on Pallet NFTs & Pallet Uniques on Polkadot AssetHub.

### UI Explorers Challenges

**Limited NFT Support Due to Varied Implementations**

Different NFT standards across Polkadot parachains result in incomplete or inconsistent display, with many explorers lacking full support.

**Gaps in Indexing & Metadata Display**

Inconsistent NFT indexing leads to missing images, unparsed attributes, and inaccurate ownership data, making asset tracking unreliable.

**No Unified NFT Overview Across Chains**

Explorers are chain-specific, forcing users to manually check multiple sources to track their NFTs, with no single place to view their full portfolio.
