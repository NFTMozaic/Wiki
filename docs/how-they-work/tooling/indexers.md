# NFT Indexers 


### What is Indexer

An NFT indexer is a tool that reads, processes, and organizes blockchain data, making NFT metadata, ownership, and transaction history easily accessible for applications without directly scanning the blockchain.

### Applications

- **dApps & Marketplaces** – Need fast and structured access to NFT data for seamless user experiences.
- **Wallet Interfaces & Block Explorers** – Require standardized metadata retrieval to display NFTs properly.
- **Analytics Platforms** – Depend on reliable transaction history and ownership tracking.
- **Developers** – Need indexing APIs to avoid manually querying blockchain data.
