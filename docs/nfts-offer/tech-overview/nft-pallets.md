# Polkadot NFT Pallets

:::tip [Definition]

Pallets are modules in Substrate development environment that provide runtime logic for building and customizing blockchains.
:::

### Overview

Polkadot offers multiple pallets as ways to create and manage NFTs. 
Pallets are stable code, changes are made only to accommodate Polkadot runtime upgrades. However, rollups may decide to use one of the above pallets and customize them for their purposes. 

This article explains the main characteristics of each and their optimal usage.
