# NFT SDKs in Polkadot Ecosystem

Polkadot.JS is the primary API tool for interacting with Polkadot. It provides direct access to blockchain functionality, making it essential for low-level integrations and complex dApp architectures. However, working with raw extrinsics and runtime upgrades requires deep Polkadot knowledge and significant development effort.
Powerful but complex – Best suited for advanced developers familiar with Substrate and Polkadot internals.
Takes time to master – Learning curve spans weeks, and building even a simple minter can take a week or more.
Requires continuous maintenance – Developers must manually handle Polkadot runtime changes and network upgrades.

## Polkadot.JS: The Core API Tool

## NFT SDK

The Role of the NFT SDK

A blockchain SDK (Software Development Kit) is a middleware layer providing developers with a set of tools, libraries, and documentation to build NFT applications on top of the Polkadot ecosystem.
Why NFT SDKs Are Needed
Faster onboarding – Learning takes hours instead of weeks, and a basic minter can be built in a day.
Faster development - less complex and many scenarios are pre-built
Future-proofing – SDKs manage Polkadot runtime changes automatically, reducing maintenance efforts.
Improved performance – REST APIs enable efficient transactions, optimizing dApp speed and reducing overhead.
Specific dApp value
NFT Marketplaces – Simplifies minting, trading, and metadata management.
Wallet Interfaces – Provides standardized API for seamless NFT transfers and updates.
Gaming Apps – Enables batch minting, asset management, and in-game NFT transactions.
Other dApp Asset Pages – Ensures reliable NFT data retrieval and custom transaction execution without manual blockchain integration.

## Сonclusions

Polkadot.JS needs significant improvements in documentation, education and dev support.
Lowest hanging fruit for significant improvements in Dev experience is to add coverage of NFTs pallet/Asset Hub to Unique Network’s SDK.
Apillon SDK may serve as an alternative/backup
An open call to the community for a greenfield NFT SDK should be made, but any new solution is likely to be expensive.

## Plans

Initiate updates on Polkadot.JS education and support materials to improve it’s appeal.
Publish the call for proposals for the NFT SDK and plan further actions based on the response.

Proposed Specification for an ideal “to be”  SDK.
